# smz2018
Slides and projects used at http://www.lmz-bw.de/landesmedienzentrum/medienzentren/stadtmedienzentrum-karlsruhe-am-lmz/veranstaltungen-am-smz/tagung-mediennetzwerk-ka.html

Data are taken from https://transparenz.karlsruhe.de/, some manually modified to make handling more convenient (credits for editiing CSVs go to Josef and his team)
Processing tools used are geojson.io, orange3 and qlik, for URLs see the slides
You will need to adjust the location of the input files when you open the orange3 projects. Also, you will need to set the data merging link on poi_grp_id on the poi projects.

A typical Orange3 install will need the following extension (see extension manager in Orange GUI)

  * timeseries
  * geo (or geo-mapping)
  * text
  * textables
